# Wholesome Examples

Wholesome Examples is a WordPress **R&D** plugin. Examples of best practice development are built inside this plugin.

In theory you should be able to download this plugin, and see working examples of the code.

The plugin has many moving parts, but is not intended to work together as a singular plugin. Its functionality is for example and education only.

The goal of this plugin is to be the first place where a piece of functionality is developed, before it is either moved into a standalone plugin, or incorporated into an existing project.
