# Wholesome Examples

Wholesome Examples is an **R&D** (Research and Development) plugin where examples of best practice plugin development are built inside a working plugin.

In theory you should be able to download this plugin, and see the examples in action.

The plugin has many moving parts, but is not intended to work together as a singular plugin. Its functionality is for example only.

The goal of this plugin is to be the first place where a piece of functionality is developed, before it is either moved into a standalone plugin, or incorporated into an existing project.
